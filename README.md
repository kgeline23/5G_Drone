# 5G_Drone
The goal was for this project was to promote 5G to the different industries (for example in healthcare, mixed reality, industry 4.0, etc.), therefore I worked on building a drone demonstrator within the 5G Hub Einhoven.

The project is to redesign and improve the currently existing drone by making it controllable via a PC application and having a live camera feed. In addition, the application reads values from added sensors and respond accordingly. For example, when a drone flies too close to an object it will stop and maintain its current position. 
At the end of the internship the video stream should be visible via PC.

The end product was a redesign of the drone in which the RaspberryPi, 3D camera and the sensors are attached to the drone. Alongside this a python client application, to receive commands for the drone and read sensor values, and a C# server application for the user to send commands and receive feedback from sensor values and video stream.
